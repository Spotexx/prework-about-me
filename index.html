      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>They say that if you love what you do for your job then you never need to work a day in your life. 
        When I wrote my first javascript function,  I was ecstatic. I find manipulating data and growing my 
        ability exciting.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from Kingston, Ontario. I lived a couple years in north york and Brampton as well.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I don't like to tie myself down to only a few hobbies im always trying new things. However If I were
         to pick some of my favourits I would choose Music, Online games, and FPV drones.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm still working that out. I spent a few years in the toronto area as an accountant but now I've decided 
        I'd like to move more into the development sector. I've spent some time building my skills in react, material 
        ui and bootstrap over the last year to start developing my skills in webdevelopment. I also find the field of AI quite fascinating</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Kingston Ontario</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I find it fascinating to use the tools given to me to manipulate data and contstruct visually appealing websites. I want 
        to improve my skills to be able to work both the frontend and backend to further my education in web development.
